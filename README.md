Hierarchical Event Descriptor (HED) Tags and related tools.

In the same way that we tag a picture on Flicker, or a video clip on Youtube (e.g. cat, cute, funny), we can tag EEG experimental event types used in event-related EEG research. In this document we introduce Hierarchical Event Descriptors (HED), a set of descriptor tags partially adopted from the BrainMap ontology (brainmap.org) and organized hierarchically. HED tags can be used to describe many types of EEG experiment events in a uniform, extensible, and machine readable manner.
