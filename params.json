{"name":"Hierarchical Event Descriptor (HED) Tags and related tools","tagline":"Removing the pain from EEG data sharing","body":"HED tags are assigned to event codes (also known as triggers or event numbers) in EEG recordings and allow humans and computers to better understand what these codes represent (e.g. code #5 -> Target detection in an RSVP paradigm).\r\n\r\n===\r\n\r\n## Why tags?\r\n\r\nIn the same way that we tag a picture on Flicker, or a video clip on Youtube (e.g. cat, cute, funny), we can tag EEG experimental event types used in event-related EEG research. Hierarchical Event Descriptors (HED) is a set of descriptor tags partially adopted from BrainMap/NeuroLex ontologies and organized hierarchically. HED tags can be used to describe many types of EEG experiment events in a uniform, extensible, and machine readable manner.\r\n\r\n## How do I start?\r\nFollow these steps:\r\n\r\n1. Read [HED reference paper](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/~nima/downloads/HED_globalsip_paper.pdf).\r\n\r\n2. Read this [step-by-step guide](http://hedtags.org/schema) in conjunction with [HED 2.0 schema document] (https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=9DC836DC7A997479!115&authkey=!ACi480_rvitE8vY&ithint=file%2cdocx).  \r\n\r\n## Tools\r\n\r\n1. [CTAGGER](http://visual.cs.utsa.edu/projects/ctagger) is a MATLAB/Java toolbox that implements a user-friendly, semi-structured and expandable strategy for event annotation in dynamic brain imaging and other time-series. You can use this tool to assign HED tags to your events (e.g. in EEGLAB).\r\n\r\n2. [rERP Toolbox](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/EEGLAB/RERP) is an open source Matlab toolbox for calculating overlapping Event Related Potentials (ERP) by multiple regression (an alternative to averaging). It can also perform regression on HED tags.\r\n\r\n## Who is using HED tags?\r\n\r\n* [National Database for Autism Research (NDAR)](http://ndar.nih.gov/)\r\n* [CaN-CTA project of Army Research Labaratory](http://cancta.net)\r\n* [EEG Study Schema (ESS)](http://www.eegstudy.org)\r\n* [HeadIT.org](http://HeadIT.org)\r\n\r\n## People\r\n\r\n* Nima Bigdely-Shamlo ([Syntogi, Inc.](http://www.syntrogi.com))\r\n* Kay Robbins (University of Texas San Antonio)\r\n* Scott Makeig (Swartz Center, UCSD).\r\n* Christian Kothe (Swartz Center, UCSD).\r\n* Makoto Miyakoshi (Swartz Center, UCSD).\r\n\r\nand many others.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nHED was originally developed under HeadIT project at Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience (SCCN) of the University of California, San Diego and funded by U.S. National Institutes of Health grants R01-MH084819 (Makeig, Grethe PIs) and R01-NS047293 (Makeig PI). HED development is now supported by The Cognition and Neuroergonomics Collaborative Technology Alliance (CaN CTA) program of U.S Army Research Labaratory.","google":"UA-46460712-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
