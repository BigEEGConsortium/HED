{"name":"Hierarchical Event Descriptor (HED) Tags and related tools","tagline":"Removing the pain from EEG data sharing","body":"HED tags are assigned to event codes (also known as triggers or event numbers) in EEG recordings and allow humans and computers to better understand what these codes represent (e.g. code #5 -> Target detection in an RSVP paradigm).\r\n\r\n===\r\n\r\n## Why tags?\r\n\r\nIn the same way that we tag a picture on Flicker, or a video clip on Youtube (e.g. cat, cute, funny), we can tag EEG experimental event types used in event-related EEG research. Hierarchical Event Descriptors (HED) is a set of descriptor tags partially adopted from BrainMap/NeuroLex ontologies and organized hierarchically. HED tags can be used to describe many types of EEG experiment events in a uniform, extensible, and machine readable manner.\r\n\r\n%% Examples\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Documents\r\n\r\n## Tools\r\n\r\n## HED-tagged EEG Studies\r\n\r\n## People\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nHED was originally developed under HeadIT project at Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience (SCCN) of the University of California, San Diego and funded by U.S. National Institutes of Health grants R01-MH084819 (Makeig, Grethe PIs) and R01-NS047293 (Makeig PI). HED development is now supported by The Cognition and Neuroergonomics Collaborative Technology Alliance (CaN CTA) program of U.S Army Research Labaratory.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
