{"name":"Hierarchical Event Descriptor (HED) Tags and related tools","tagline":"Removing the pain from EEG data sharing","body":"HED tags are assigned to event codes (aka triggers, event numbers) in EEG recordings and allow humans and computers to better understand \r\n\r\n===\r\n\r\nHierarchical Event Descriptor (HED) Tags and related tools.\r\n\r\nIn the same way that we tag a picture on Flicker, or a video clip on Youtube (e.g. cat, cute, funny), we can tag EEG experimental event types used in event-related EEG research. In this document we introduce Hierarchical Event Descriptors (HED), a set of descriptor tags partially adopted from the BrainMap ontology (brainmap.org) and organized hierarchically. HED tags can be used to describe many types of EEG experiment events in a uniform, extensible, and machine readable manner. \r\n\r\n\r\nPeople\r\n\r\n===\r\n=\r\n\r\nHED was originally developed under HeadIT project at Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience (SCCN) of the University of California, San Diego and funded by U.S. National Institutes of Health grants R01-MH084819 (Makeig, Grethe PIs) and R01-NS047293 (Makeig PI). HED development is now supported by The Cognition and Neuroergonomics Collaborative Technology Alliance (CaN CTA) program of U.S Army Research Labaratory.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
